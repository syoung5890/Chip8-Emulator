[Chip 8 is a virtual computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) created in 1977 by Joseph Weisbecker. Chip 8 has 16 8 bit registers, 4 Kilobytes of memory, a black and white screen, 16 user inputs, and simple audio. I wrote this particual emulator in Java, using the Swing framework for the graphics.
